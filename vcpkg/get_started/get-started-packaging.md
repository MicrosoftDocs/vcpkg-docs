# Tutorial: Create and publish packages

This tutorial guides you on how to package a library for vcpkg using a custom overlay. We recommended that you read the [Install and use packages with CMake](get-started.md) tutorial before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

- A terminal
- A C++ compiler
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

::: zone pivot="shell-cmd, shell-powershell"

> [!NOTE]
> For Windows users, Visual Studio's MSVC is the required compiler for C++ development.

::: zone-end

## 1 - Set up vcpkg

[!INCLUDE [setup-vcpkg](includes/setup-vcpkg.md)]

## 2 - Configure the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable

To set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variables, run the following commands:

::: zone pivot="shell-bash"

```bash
export VCPKG_ROOT=/path/to/vcpkg
export PATH=$VCPKG_ROOT:$PATH
```

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable using the `export` command only affects the current shell session. To make this change permanent across sessions, you'll need to add the `export` command to your shell's profile script (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="shell-cmd"

```console
set VCPKG_ROOT="C:\path\to\vcpkg"
set PATH=%VCPKG_ROOT%;%PATH%
```

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable using the `set` command only affects the current shell session. To make this change permanent across sessions, you can use the `setx` command and restart the shell session.

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="shell-powershell"

```powershell
$env:VCPKG_ROOT = "C:\path\to\vcpkg"
$env:PATH = "$env:VCPKG_ROOT;$env:PATH"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the `VCPKG_ROOT` and updating the `PATH` environment variables in this manner only affects the current PowerShell session. To make these changes permanent across all sessions, you should add them to your PowerShell profile or set them through the Windows System Environment Variables panel.
::: zone-end

Setting `VCPKG_ROOT` tells vcpkg where your vcpkg instance is located.
Adding it to `PATH` ensures you can run vcpkg commands directly from the shell.

## 3 - Set up the custom overlay

1. Create a new directory called `custom-overlay` next to the `Hello World` project you created in the [Install and use packages with CMake](get-started.md) tutorial.
2. Within `custom-overlay` directory, create a folder named `vcpkg-sample-library`.

## 4 - Set up the port files

First, create the `vcpkg.json` file within the `custom-overlay\vcpkg-sample-library` folder with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "vcpkg-sample-library",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-docs/tree/cmake-sample-lib",
  "description": "A sample C++ library designed to serve as a foundational example for a tutorial on packaging libraries with vcpkg.",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "name" : "vcpkg-cmake",
      "host" : true
    },
    {
      "name" : "vcpkg-cmake-config",
      "host" : true
    },
    "fmt"
  ]
}
```

The `vcpkg.json` file serves as a manifest that defines metadata and dependencies for a C++ library, providing vcpkg with the necessary information to build, install, and manage the package.

- `name`: Specifies the name of the library. This is used as the package identifier.
- `version`: Indicates the version number of the library.
- `homepage`: URL to the project's homepage, often its repository. Useful for those who want to know more or contribute.
- `description`: Brief text describing what the library does. This is for documentation and users.
- `license`: Specifies the license under which the library is distributed.
- `dependencies`: An array containing the list of dependencies that the library needs.
- `name`: `vcpkg-cmake`: Specifies a dependency on `vcpkg-cmake`, which provides CMake functions and macros commonly used in vcpkg ports.
- `host`: true: Specifies that `vcpkg-cmake` is a host dependency, meaning it's required for building the package but not for using it.
- `name`: `vcpkg-cmake-config`: Specifies a dependency on `vcpkg-cmake-config`, which assists in using CMake config scripts.
- `fmt`: Specifies a run-time dependency on the `fmt` library. This means `fmt` is required for both building and using the package.

For more information on `vcpkg.json`, see the following documentation on [manifests](../reference/vcpkg-json.md).

Now, create the `usage` file within the `custom-overlay\vcpkg-sample-library` directory with the following content:

```
vcpkg-sample-library provides CMake targets:

find_package(my_sample_lib CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE my_sample_lib::my_sample_lib)
```

Providing usage documentation for ports allows users to easily adopt them in their projects. We highly encourage providing a `usage` file within the port's directory (`ports/<port name>/usage`) that describes the minimal steps necessary to integrate with a build system. To determine the correct usage instructions it is recommended to follow upstream's guidance. In the case that upstream does not provide usage information, it may be necessary to dig through their build system to find the exported targets.

For more guidance, see [handling usage files](../maintainers/handling-usage-files.md)

Finally, create the `portfile.cmake` file within the `custom-overlay\vcpkg-sample-library` directory with the following content:

```
vcpkg_check_linkage(ONLY_STATIC_LIBRARY)

vcpkg_from_github(
    OUT_SOURCE_PATH SOURCE_PATH
    REPO Microsoft/vcpkg-docs
    REF "${VERSION}"
    SHA512 0  # This is a temporary value. We will modify this value in the next section.
    HEAD_REF cmake-sample-lib
)


vcpkg_cmake_configure(
    SOURCE_PATH "${SOURCE_PATH}"
)

vcpkg_cmake_install()

vcpkg_cmake_config_fixup(PACKAGE_NAME "my_sample_lib")

file(REMOVE_RECURSE "${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/debug/include")

file(INSTALL "${SOURCE_PATH}/LICENSE" DESTINATION "${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/share/${PORT}" RENAME copyright)
configure_file("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/usage" "${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/share/${PORT}/usage" COPYONLY)
```

This `portfile` defines how to download, build, install, and package a specific C++ library from GitHub using vcpkg.

- `vcpkg_check_linkage(ONLY_STATIC_LIBRARY)`: Specifies that only static linking is supported for this package.
- `vcpkg_from_github`: Starts the function to download the source code from a GitHub repository.
  - `OUT_SOURCE_PATH SOURCE_PATH`: Sets the directory where the source code will be extracted.
  - `REPO JavierMatosD/vcpkg-sample-library`: The GitHub repository containing the source code.
  - `REF "${VERSION}"`: The version of the source code to download.
  - `SHA512 0`: Placeholder for the SHA-512 hash of the source code for integrity verification.
  - `HEAD_REF main`: Specifies the default branch for the repository.
- `vcpkg_cmake_configure`: Configures the project using CMake, setting up the build.
  - `SOURCE_PATH "${SOURCE_PATH}"`: The path to the source code downloaded earlier.
- `vcpkg_cmake_install()`: Builds and installs the package using CMake.
- `vcpkg_cmake_config_fixup(PACKAGE_NAME "my_sample_lib")`: Fixes the CMake package configuration files to be compatible with Vcpkg.
- `file(REMOVE_RECURSE "${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/debug/include")`: Deletes the include directory from the debug installation to prevent overlap.
- `file(INSTALL "${SOURCE_PATH}/LICENSE" DESTINATION ...)`: Installs the LICENSE file to the package's share directory and renames it to copyright.
- `configure_file("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/usage" ...)`: Copies a usage instruction file to the package's share directory.

For more information, refer to the [maintainer guide](../contributing/maintainer-guide.md).

## 5 - Update SHA512 for `portfile.cmake`

Run:

```console
vcpkg install vcpkg-sample-library --overlay-ports=C:\path\to\custom-overlay
```

You will get a long error message. Scan the output until you find:

```console
Expected hash: 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

```

Copy the "Actual hash"  `56cffcf9bfb6e9c6bc41e28ae58e8ad25c112db49eafa63f20f95c1ced5712ba7bada9e0990741f70a3f45a4cfd6cb25a3500ef04d36037309b1b65e2f8b569d`, and replace the `SHA512` value in the `portfile.cmake` with its value.

Re-run the install command:

```console
vcpkg install vcpkg-sample-library --overlay-ports=C:\path\to\custom-overlay
```

```

vcpkg-sample-library provides CMake targets:

  find_package(my_sample_lib CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE my_sample_lib::my_sample_lib)
```

## 6 - Verify the port build

To verify the library builds and links properly, add the new dependency to the manifest and configuration files.

Modify `vcpkg.json` to add the `vcpkg-sample-library` dependency:

```json
{
    "dependencies": [
        "fmt",
        "vcpkg-sample-library"
    ]
}
```

Modify `vcpkg-configuration.json` to include the `overlay-ports` containing the new port:

```json
{
  "default-registry": {
    "kind": "git",
    "baseline": "45f6e57d3e10ad96b7db206cf7888f736ba5aa61",
    "repository": "https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg"
  },
  "registries": [
    {
      "kind": "artifact",
      "location": "https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg-ce-catalog/archive/refs/heads/main.zip",
      "name": "microsoft"
    }
  ],
  "overlay-ports": [
    "../custom-overlay/vcpkg-sample-library"
  ]
}
```

Next, modify the `CMakeLists.txt` and `main.cpp` created in the [Install and use packages with
CMake](get-started.md) tutorial.

Modify the `CMakeLists.txt` with the following content:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

project(HelloWorld)

find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)
find_package(my_sample_lib CONFIG REQUIRED)  # Add this line

add_executable(HelloWorld helloworld.cpp)

target_link_libraries(HelloWorld PRIVATE fmt::fmt)
target_link_libraries(HelloWorld PRIVATE my_sample_lib::my_sample_lib)  # Add this line
```

Modify the `main.cpp` with the following content:

```cpp
#include "my_sample_lib.h"  // Replace #include <fmt/core.h> with "my_sample_lib.h"

int main()
{
    greet("World!");  // Replace fmt::print("Hello World!\n) with this line
    return 0;
}

```

Configure, build, and run the application.

1. Configure the build using CMake:

  ```console
  cmake --preset=default
  ```

2. Build the project:

  ```console
  cmake --build build
  ```

3. Run the application:

  ```console
  ./build/HelloWorld
  ```

  ```
  Hello World!
  ```

## Next steps

Now that the `vcpkg-sample-library` has been packaged as port, the next step is to add it to the vcpkg curated registry. See, [Adding ports to vcpkg registry](get-started-adding-to-registry.md)
