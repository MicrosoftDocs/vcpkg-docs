# Tutorial: Add a port to the vcpkg open-source registry

This tutorial guides you on how to package a library for vcpkg using a custom overlay. We recommended that you read the [Packaging a library](get-started-packaging.md) tutorial before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

- A terminal
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## 1 - Fork the vcpkg Repository

1. Navigate to the [vcpkg GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg).
2. Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the page.
3. Choose your GitHub account as the destination for the fork.

## 2 - Add your fork as a remote

Navigate to the directory where you've cloned the original vcpkg repository, then add your fork as a remote. Replace `<Your-GitHub-Username>` with your GitHub username:

```console
git remote add myfork https://github.com/<Your-GitHub-Username>/vcpkg.git
```

You can check that the remote was added correctly by running:

```console
git remote -v
```

You should see `myfork` listed among the remotes.

## 3 - Create a topic branch

Before making changes, it's usually good to create a new [branch](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-flow):

```console
git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
```

## 4 - Copy the overlay port to the `ports` directory

Add the `vcpkg-sample-library` port that was created in the [packaging a library](get-started-packaging.md) tutorial to the `vcpkg\ports` directory:

::: zone pivot="shell-bash"

```bash
cp -R <path/to/vcpkg-sample-library> <ports/vcpkg-sample-library>
```

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="shell-cmd"

```console
xcopy <path/to/vcpkg-sample-library> <ports/vcpkg-sample-library> /E
```

::: zone-end
::: zone pivot="shell-powershell"

```powershell
Copy-Item -Path <path/to/vcpkg-sample-library> -Destination <ports/vcpkg-sample-library> -Recurse
```

::: zone-end

## 5 - Commit and push changes

1. Commit the changes:

   ```console
    git add ports/<library-name>
    git commit -m "Add vcpkg-sample-library to vcpkg"
   ```

2. Run `vcpkg x-add-version`:

   ```console
   vcpkg x-add-version vcpkg-sample-library
   ```

3. Commit version changes

   ```
    git commit -m "version database"
   ```

4. Push the changes to your fork:

   ```console
   git push myfork <topic-branch-name>
   ```

## 6 - Create a pull request

1. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on "Compare & pull request" button.
   1. Verify the changes
   2. Add a descriptive title and comments
   3. Fill out the [pr review checklist](../contributing/pr-review-checklist.md)
3. Click "Create pull request."

That's it! You've successfully added a `port` to vcpkg's curated registry.
