# Tutorial: Package a private Azure DevOps dependency

This tutorial guides you through creating an overlay port for a library hosted on a private Azure DevOps repository, covering authentication setup and packaging into an overlay.

## Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of Git and vcpkg.
- Access to Azure DevOps with permissions to create projects and manage SSH keys.
- `vcpkg` installed on your system.
- Git installed on your system.

## 1 - Create a private project

1. Log into your Azure DevOps account
2. Create a new private project. If you don't have an organization, you'll be prompted to create one during the project creation process.
    - **Name your project**: Choose a meaningful name that reflects your library or its purpose.
    - **Visibility**: Ensure the project is set to "Private" to control access.

## 2 - Set Up Authentication in Azure DevOps

Secure access to your repository with SSH keys.

1. Generate an SSH Key Pair

    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Run the following command:

        ```console
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ADO-RSA" -f /path/to/.ssh/id_rsa_ado
        ```

        - `-t rsa`: Specifies the type of key to create, in this case, RSA.
        - `-b 4096`: Sets the number of bits in the key, in this case, 4096, which is considered strong and secure.
        - `-C "ADO-RSA"`: Adds a label to the key for identification, which can be particularly useful when you have multiple keys.
        - `-f /path/to/.ssh/id_rsa_ado`: Specifies the filename for the new key. This command saves the private key to `id_rsa_ado` and the public key to `id_rsa_ado.pub`.

        You'll be prompted to enter a passphrase for additional security. You can either enter a passphrase or press Enter to proceed without one. A passphrase adds an extra layer of security by requiring the passphrase to be entered whenever the key is used.

    - After the key generation, confirm the new key is created by listing the contents of your `/.ssh/` directory again:
        ```console
        ls /path/to/.ssh
        ```

2. Add your SSH key to Azure DevOps
    - Open the `id_rsa_ado.pub` file with a text editor to view the public key.
    - Copy the entire content of the file.
    - Navigate to your **User Settings > SSH Public Keys**.

        ![User Settings > SSH Public Keys](../resources/pkg_ado_dep/ado-add-public-key-1.png)

    - Add your new key by pasting the copied content and name your key for future reference.

        ![Add the Key](../resources/pkg_ado_dep/ado-add-public-key-2.png)

3. Load your SSH key into the SSH agent.

    Ensure your SSH key is available for authentication:

    ```console
    ssh-add /path/to/.ssh/id_rsa_ado
    ```

4. Test SSH connection

    Verify connectivity to Azure DevOps:

    ```console
    ssh -T git@ssh.dev.azure.com
    ```

    Expect a message indicating successful authentication but noting that shell access is not supported.

    ```
    ssh -T git@ssh.dev.azure.com
    remote: Shell access is not supported.
    shell request failed on channel 0
    ```
    
## 3 - Upload library to Azure DevOps repo

1. Initialize a local git repository
    
    Navigate to your library's source code directory and initialize a Git repository:

    ```console
    git init
    ```

2. Commit your library
    Add and commit your library's source code:

    ```console
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit of the sample library"
    ```

3. Link to Your Azure DevOps Repository

    Retrieve your repository's SSH URL from Azure DevOps and add it as a remote:

    ![SSH URL](../resources/pkg_ado_dep/ado-get-url.png)

    ```console
    git remote add origin <Your-Repo-SSH-URL>
    ```

4. Push Your Library

    Upload your library to the Azure DevOps repository:

    ```console
    git push -u origin master:main
    ```

## 4 - Package your library into an overlay port

[Overlay ports](../concepts/overlay-ports.md) allow you to use local ports with vcpkg.

1. Create an overlay ports directory

    ```console
    mkdir vcpkg-overlay-ports
    cd vcpkg-overlay-ports
    ```

2. Set up the port files

- `vcpkg.json`: This manifest file defines your library's metadata and dependencies.

    **Disclaimer**: The following examples use placeholders. Replace them with your actual data.

    ```json
    {
        "name": "your-library-name",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "Description of your library.",
        "dependencies": []
    }
    ```

    The `vcpkg.json` file serves as a manifest that defines metadata and dependencies for a C++ library, providing vcpkg with the necessary information to build, install, and manage the package.

    - `name`: Specifies the name of the library. This is used as the package identifier.
    - `version`: Indicates the version number of the library.
    - `description`: Brief text describing what the library does. This is for documentation and users.
    - `dependencies`: An array containing the list of dependencies that the library needs.

    For more information on how to set up your `vcpkg.json`, check out our [reference documentation](../reference/vcpkg-json.md).

- `portfile.cmake` : This script tells vcpkg how to build your library.
    ```cmake
    vcpkg_from_git(
        OUT_SOURCE_PATH SOURCE_PATH
        URL "git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/YourOrg/YourProject/YourRepo"
        REF "<commit-sha>"
    )

    vcpkg_cmake_configure(SOURCE_PATH "${SOURCE_PATH}")
    vcpkg_cmake_install()
    vcpkg_cmake_config_fixup(PACKAGE_NAME your-library-name)
    file(INSTALL "${SOURCE_PATH}/LICENSE" DESTINATION "${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/share/your-library-name")
    ```

    This portfile defines how to download, build, install, and package a specific C++ library from GitHub using vcpkg.

    - `vcpkg_from_git`: Starts the function to download the source code from a git repository.
    - `OUT_SOURCE_PATH SOURCE_PATH`: Sets the directory where the source code will be extracted.
    - `URL git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/YourOrg/YourProject/YourRepo`: The SSH URL for the repository containing the source code.
    - `REF <commit-sha>`: The commit SHA of your library's code in Azure DevOps.
    - `vcpkg_cmake_configure`: Configures the project using CMake, setting up the build.
        -  `SOURCE_PATH "${SOURCE_PATH}"`: The path to the source code downloaded earlier.
    - `vcpkg_cmake_install()`: Builds and installs the package using CMake.
    - `vcpkg_cmake_config_fixup(PACKAGE_NAME your-library-name)`: Fixes the CMake package configuration files to be compatible with Vcpkg.
    - `file(INSTALL "${SOURCE_PATH}/LICENSE" DESTINATION ...)`: Installs the LICENSE file to the package's share directory and renames it to copyright.

    To obtain the commit SHA:

    ```console
    mkdir temp && cd temp
    git init
    git fetch <Your-Repo-SSH-URL> main --depth 1 -n
    git rev-parse FETCH_HEAD
    ```

    For more information on how to set up your `portfile.cmake`,  checkout the following articles:
    - [Ports concepts](../concepts/ports.md)
    - [Overlay Ports](../concepts/overlay-ports.md)
    - [vcpkg_from_git](../maintainers/functions/vcpkg_from_git.md)
    - [Portfile Variables](../maintainers/variables.md)
    - [Triplets](../users/triplets.md)

3. Install your port

    Back in your main vcpkg directory, install your library specifying the overlay ports directory:

    ```console
    vcpkg install your-library-name --overlay-ports=/path/to/vcpkg-overlay-ports
    ```

## Next Steps

You've successfully packaged a private Azure DevOps repository as a vcpkg port. This tutorial is intended as a guideline; please adapt the instructions to fit your specific library and development environment.
