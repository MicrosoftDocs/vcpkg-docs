# vcpkg_extract_source_archive_ex

**This function has been deprecated in favor of [`vcpkg_extract_source_archive()`].**

Extract an archive.

## Usage

```cmake
vcpkg_extract_source_archive_ex(
    [OUT_SOURCE_PATH <out-var>]
    [<options>...]
)
```

This command forwards all options to [`vcpkg_extract_source_archive()`], with `<out-var>` as the first argument. Equivalent to `vcpkg_extract_source_archive(<out-var> <options>...)`. For parameter help, see the documentation for [`vcpkg_extract_source_archive()`](vcpkg_extract_source_archive.md).
