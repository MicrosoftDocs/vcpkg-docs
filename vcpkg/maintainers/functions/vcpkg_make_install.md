# vcpkg_make_install

Build and install a Make-based project.

## Usage

```cmake
vcpkg_make_install(
    [DISABLE_PARALLEL]
    [LOGFILE_ROOT <root-name>]
    [MAKEFILE <makefile-name>]
    [TARGETS <target-name>...]
    [OPTIONS <make-option>...]
    [OPTIONS_RELEASE <make-option>...]
    [OPTIONS_DEBUG <make-option>...]
)
```

To use this function, you must depend on the helper port `vcpkg-make`:

```json
"dependencies": [
  {
    "name": "vcpkg-make",
    "host": true
  }
]
```

## Parameters

### ADD_BIN_TO_PATH

Adds the configure dependent `(debug/)bin` directory to the system path. This is useful if configure builds and runs executables with shared dependencies.

### DISABLE_PARALLEL

By default, `vcpkg_make_install` runs make with the `-j` option to enable parallel building. If your project does not support parallel builds or you encounter issues with it, set this flag to disable parallel building. This causes `make` to be executed without the `-j` option, running build steps sequentially.

### LOGFILE_ROOT

Specifies the base name for log files generated by the build. Defaults to "make".

### MAKEFILE

Specifies the name of the makefile to use. Defaults to "Makefile".

### TARGETS

Specifies the targets to pass to make. Defaults to "all;install".

### OPTIONS

Additional options to pass to `make` during the build.

### OPTIONS_RELEASE

Additional options to pass to `make` during the release build.

### OPTIONS_DEBUG

Additional options to pass to `make` during the debug build.

## Examples

```cmake
vcpkg_from_github(OUT_SOURCE_PATH source_path ...)
vcpkg_make_configure(SOURCE_PATH "${source_path}")
vcpkg_make_install()
```

## Remarks

This command replaces [`vcpkg_install_make()`](vcpkg_install_make.md).
