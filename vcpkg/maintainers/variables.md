# Portfile variable reference

These are variables set automatically by vcpkg for use in any port. They should not be modified by the port.

Full list of variables is defined in the [vcpkg_common_definitions](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/scripts/cmake/vcpkg_common_definitions.cmake) module.

### PORT

The name of the port that is currently being built.

### VERSION

The version of the port that is currently being built.

Does not contain the ["port-version"](../users/versioning.md#port-version).

### VCPKG_TARGET_IS_\<system\>

Defined to a true value if building for *\<system\>*.

Supported systems:
- `VCPKG_TARGET_IS_WINDOWS` (*also true for UWP and MinGW*)
- `VCPKG_TARGET_IS_UWP`
- `VCPKG_TARGET_IS_MINGW`
- `VCPKG_TARGET_IS_LINUX`
- `VCPKG_TARGET_IS_OSX`
- `VCPKG_TARGET_IS_IOS`
- `VCPKG_TARGET_IS_ANDROID`
- `VCPKG_TARGET_IS_FREEBSD`
- `VCPKG_TARGET_IS_OPENBSD`
- `VCPKG_TARGET_IS_EMSCRIPTEN`

### VCPKG_HOST_IS_\<system\>

Defined to a true value if building on *\<system\>*.

Supported systems:
- `VCPKG_HOST_IS_WINDOWS`
- `VCPKG_HOST_IS_OSX`
- `VCPKG_HOST_IS_LINUX`
- `VCPKG_HOST_IS_FREEBSD`
- `VCPKG_HOST_IS_OPENBSD`

### VCPKG_HOST_PATH_SEPARATOR

Host specific path separator.

Always use quotes when expanding `VCPKG_HOST_PATH_SEPARATOR` since it may contain a semicolon. For example:

```cmake
set(ENV{SOMEPATH} "$ENV{SOMEPATH}${VCPKG_HOST_PATH_SEPARATOR}${my_extra_path}")
```

### VCPKG_HOST_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX

Executable suffix for the building system.

This is set to `".exe"` on Windows and `""` on other platforms.

### VCPKG_TARGET_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX

Executable suffix for the built-for system.

This is set to `".exe"` when [`VCPKG_TARGET_IS_WINDOWS`](#vcpkg_target_is_system) and `""` otherwise.

### VCPKG_HOST_BUNDLE_SUFFIX

Bundle suffix of the building system.

### VCPKG_TARGET_BUNDLE_SUFFIX

Bundle suffix of the built-for system.

### VCPKG_TARGET_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX

Static library prefix for the built-for system.

See also [`CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX.html).

### VCPKG_TARGET_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX

Static library suffix for the built-for system.

See also [`CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX.html).

### VCPKG_TARGET_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX

Shared (dynamic) library prefix for the built-for system.

See also [`CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX.html).

### VCPKG_TARGET_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX

Shared (dynamic) library suffix for the built-for system.

See also [`CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX.html).

### VCPKG_TARGET_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX

Import library prefix for the built-for system.

See also [`CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX.html).

### VCPKG_TARGET_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX

Import library suffix for the built-for system.

See also [`CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX.html).

### VCPKG_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES

Prefixes used for [`find_library()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_library.html) calls in portfiles.

These are set to 

### VCPKG_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES

Suffixes used for [`find_library()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_library.html) calls in portfiles.

### TARGET_TRIPLET

The name of the [triplet](../users/triplets.md) being built for.

### CURRENT_INSTALLED_DIR

The absolute path to the installed files for the [target triplet](#target_triplet).

### HOST_TRIPLET

The name of the [triplet](../users/triplets.md) that matches the building system.

### CURRENT_HOST_INSTALLED_DIR

The absolute path to the installed files for the [host triplet](#host_triplet).

### VCPKG_CROSSCOMPILING

Whether vcpkg is compiling for a different system than the building machine.

This is the same as comparing [`TARGET_TRIPLET`](#target_triplet) and [`HOST_TRIPLET`](#host_triplet) for equality. If the triplets are different, ports must not assume that they can run the results of a build.

For example, when compiling for Android from MacOS, `VCPKG_CROSSCOMPILING` will be set to a true value.
