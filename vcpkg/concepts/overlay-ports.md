# Overlay ports

Usually, vcpkg ports are obtained from [registries](../concepts/registries.md). It is very likely that most of the ports you install come from the official vcpkg registry at <https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg>. vcpkg lets you install ports available to you via the file system, we call these ports, overlay ports.

An overlay port can act as a drop-in replacement for an existing port or as a new port that is otherwise not available in a [registry](../maintainers/registries.md). While [resolving package names](../concepts/package-name-resolution.md), overlay ports take priority.

Overlay ports are evaluated in the following order:

* The directory specified in the command-line via [`--overlay-ports`](../commands/common-options.md#overlay-ports), or named subdirectories if that directory has no `CONTROL` or `vcpkg.json` file.
* The directory specified in a `vcpkg-configuration.json` file via [`overlay-ports`](../reference/vcpkg-configuration-json.md), or named subdirectories if that directory has no `CONTROL` or `vcpkg.json` file.
* The directory specified by [`VCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS`](../users/config-environment.md#vcpkg_overlay_ports) environment variable entries, or named subdirectories if that directory has no `CONTROL` or `vcpkg.json` file.

When resolving port names, the first location that contains a matching overlay port is selected.

## Using an overlay port

If an overlay port is specified, first, vcpkg attempts to load that directory as a port. If that succeeds, the directory itself is itself treated as a port, and the name of the overlay is derived from the `CONTROL` or `vcpkg.json` file. Otherwise, subdirectories with the overlay port name are considered.

Valid ports contain `portfile.cmake`, and either `vcpkg.json` or `CONTROL`.

For example, consider the following directory structure:

* `x/vcpkg.json`, the `"name"` field is set to `"a"`.
* `x/portfile.cmake`, the associated build instructions for `a`.
* `x/b/vcpkg.json`, the `"name"` field is set to `"b"`.
* `x/b/portfile.cmake`, the associated build instructions for `b`.
* `y/c/vcpkg.json`, the `"name"` field is set to `"c"`.
* `y/c/portfile.cmake`, the associated build instructions for `c`.
* `y/d/vcpkg.json`, the `"name"` field is set to `"d"`.
* `y/d/portfile.cmake`, the associated build instructions for `d`.

vcpkg will consider the following ports given the following settings:

* `--overlay-ports=x`: There is one port in this overlay, `a`. The name is derived from `vcpkg.json`. The subdirectory `b` is not considered.
* `--overlay-ports=x/b`: There is one port in this overlay, `b`. The name is derived from `vcpkg.json`.
* `--overlay-ports=y`: There are two ports in this overlay, `c` and `d`. Their names are derived from the subdirectories of `y`, and the names declared in their `vcpkg.json` must match, or an error will be generated if vcpkg is asked to consider `c` or `d`.

You can add to the overlay port configuration in several ways:

* Command-line: Add one or more `--overlay-ports=<directory>` options to the command-line.
* [Manifest](../reference/vcpkg-configuration-json.md#overlay-ports): Populate the `"overlay-ports"` array in `vcpkg-configuration.json`.
* [Environmental variable](../users/config-environment.md#vcpkg_overlay_ports): Set `VCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS` to a path character delimited list.

### Example: Overlay Ports Example

Given this directory structure:

:::image type="complex" source="../resources/ports-overlay-example.png" alt-text="Example with multiple overlay port directories":::
Overlay directory named team-ports contains ports sqlite3, rapidjson and curl. Overlay directory named my-ports contains ports sqlite3 and rapidjson. The vcpkg directory contains the default registry.
:::image-end:::

Run:

```bash
vcpkg install sqlite3 --overlay-ports=my-ports --overlay-ports=team-ports
```

To install:

* `sqlite3` from `my-ports`

Run:

```
vcpkg install sqlite3 rapidjson curl
    --overlay-ports=my-ports/rapidjson
    --overlay-ports=vcpkg/ports/curl
    --overlay-ports=team-ports
```

To install:

* `sqlite3` from `team-ports`
* `rapidjson` from `my-ports`
* `curl` from `vcpkg/ports
