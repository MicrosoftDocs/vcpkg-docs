# Concept: Ports

A port in vcpkg is a versioned recipe that produces a set of files. Executing a port affects the installation graph by producing new header or binary files. Ports may have dependencies on other ports and may require additional dependencies when certain features are enabled. These dependencies must be reflected in the ports metadata. At a minimum, a port contains:

* Metadata about the package: name, version, supported features, dependencies, etc.
* Instructions to acquire, build if necessary, and install the package.

Additionally, ports may include:

* Patches to apply to the package's source code
* Instructions to integrate with your project's build system

## Portfile (`portfile.cmake`)

All ports must contain a portfile (a file named `portfile.cmake`). A portfile is a script that contains instructions on how to build and install a package within the vcpkg environment. Some common tasks performed by portfiles are:

* Download a package's source code.
* Build the package using the upstream build system.
* Copy the build output to the vcpkg installation tree.
* Install build system integration files.

## vcpkg.json

The `vcpkg.json` file describes metadata about the package contained in the vcpkg port. This file defines attributes like the packageâ€™s name, version, description, dependencies, supported features and platforms, etc.
See the [`vcpkg.json`](../reference/vcpkg-json.md) file reference to learn more.

## CONTROL files

> [!WARNING]
> `CONTROL` files are deprecated and only retained for backwards compatibility.

`CONTROL` files in vcpkg serve as metadata files that specify details about a package, or "port," that vcpkg can install. These files are deprecated and have largely been replaced by `vcpkg.json` manifest files for new ports. However, they are retained for backward compatibility. See [control-files](../maintainers/control-files.md) for more information.

## Patch files

In certain scenarios, a port might include patch files. These files carry modifications to the library's source code, which are essential to either fix existing issues or to maintain compatibility with other components. Before the build process begins, patches are applied as part of the steps executed by the portfile, facilitating seamless and error-free library integration. Reference the [maintainer-guide](../contributing/maintainer-guide.md#patching) to learn more.

## Port categories

Port categories are colloquial terms that maintainers use to articulate the roles different ports play within vcpkg. While these categories help describe general functionalities, it's worth noting that any given port can belong to multiple categories or perhaps none at all, based on its features and use-cases.

### Standard port

A standard port serves as a recipe for building libraries from source or providing header files for header-only libraries. It contains the instructions and metadata needed to acquire, build, and install the library. The vast majority of the libraries in the curated registry are standard ports.

### Meta port

A meta port serves to impose constraints on the install graph without having its own build files. These ports are often used to group a set of related libraries under a single name or to serve as a layer of indirection for replaceable components. For example, `boost` is a meta-port that groups together various Boost libraries under a single name for easier dependency management.

### Script port

A script port contains utility scripts that are primarily intended for internal tasks within vcpkg or for consumption by other ports. These ports enable versioning of the utility scripts, thereby maintaining compatibility and standardization. For example, `vcpkg-cmake` is a script port that exposes the [`vcpkg_cmake_configure()`](../maintainers/functions/vcpkg_cmake_configure.md)
helper function.
