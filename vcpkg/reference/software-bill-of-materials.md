# Software Bill of Materials in vcpkg
vcpkg generates a software bill of materials (SBOM) based on the [Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/) specfication. It tracks important information used to build a package, such as source origin, and aims to provide vcpkg package consumers with software transparency and integrity. See this [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/engineering-at-microsoft/generating-software-bills-of-materials-sboms-with-spdx-at-microsoft/) for more information.

A SBOM is generated for each package installed by vcpkg. It is located in `<installed_dir>/<triplet>/<share>/<package name>/vcpkg.spdx.json`.

## vcpkg specific Fields
The following fields generated by vcpkg may appear in your SBOM depending on how your package is built.

### name
Refers to the name of the document. This field contains the package name library name, triplet, version followed by the [ABI hash](users/binarycaching#abi-hash) used to identify the package.

SPDX Reference: [Document name field](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/document-creation-information/#64-document-name-field)

### creationInfo
Refers to the creator of the document, vcpkg. The `creators` field contains vcpkg followed by the version.

SPDX Reference: [Creator field](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/document-creation-information/#68-creator-field)

### relationships
Contains information about the relationship between vcpkg SPDX elements. `SPDXRef-port` refers to the port, `SPDXRef-file-N` refers to each file in the port including the `portfile.cmake` and `SPDXRef-binary` refers to the binary package. In vcpkg, the binary package is generated by the port.

SPDX Reference: [Relationships field](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/relationships-between-SPDX-elements/)

### packages
Refers to each package generated by vcpkg. `SPDXRef-port` refers to the port, and `SPDXRef-binary` refers to the binary package, and `SPDXRef-resource` refers to any sources used in vcpkg's portfile. vcpkg heuristically generates source information from the `portfile.cmake` by parsing `vcpkg_from_github`, `vcpkg_from_git`, `vcpkg_download_distfile` and `vcpkg_from_sourceforge` calls.

### files

Refers to each of the files in the port. It contains a relative path to the file and a checksum.
